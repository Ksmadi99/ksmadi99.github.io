# About Me

I'm Ksmadi, an IT Support Executive with over 1 year of professional experience, providing technical support and solutions in a fast-paced environment. I created this website to motivate myself to explore more in the IT world, share my knowledge with others, and build a platform where I can securely store and easily access my resources and data. Alongside my IT career, I offer freelance services in resume creation, data entry, and data cleaning. Explore my [services](/services/) or dive into my [tech guides](/knowledge/) to learn more!
